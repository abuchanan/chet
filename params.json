{"name":"Chet","tagline":"Genome browser","body":"Chet is a genome browser.  It is a new project, it's mostly incomplete at the moment.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the idea is to match the features of [GBrowse](http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse), with an improved user experience.\r\n Basic feature parity with GBrowse is the target of milestone 1 ([open issues](https://github.com/abuchanan/chet/issues?milestone=1&state=open)).\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nNOTE : app/dummies/tair10_features.json is missing from the repo (because it's a large file). This needs to be generated.\r\n\r\nTODO : explain how to generate this, and/or create a small dummy file\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
