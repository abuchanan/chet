Chet is a genome browser.  It is a new project, it's mostly incomplete at the moment.

Briefly, the idea is to match the features of [GBrowse](http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse), with an improved user experience.
 Basic feature parity with GBrowse is the target of milestone 1 ([open issues](https://github.com/abuchanan/chet/issues?milestone=1&state=open)).

## Development

NOTE : app/dummies/tair10_features.json is missing from the repo (because it's a large file). This needs to be generated.

TODO : explain how to generate this, and/or create a small dummy file
